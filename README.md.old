# New Zealand Census Meshblock Data

A package which provides tidied up versions of the datasets that form the
Census meshblock dataset downloadable from the
[Statistics New Zealand website](http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/data-tables/meshblock-dataset.aspx#csv)
via:

[2013 Census meshblock dataset â€“ CSV files](http://www3.stats.govt.nz/meshblock/2013/csv/2013_mb_dataset_Total_New_Zealand_CSV.zip)

## Installation

```r
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('cmhh/NZCensus')
```

## Usage

The package provides the following datasets:

* `datadictionary` - data dictionary
* `dwelling` - New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings dwelling data
* `family` - New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings family data
* `household` - New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings household data
* `individual` - New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings individual data

They can be accessed by name once the package has been loaded, or else via the
`data` function.  The datasets themselves are of type `data.table`, but the
`data.table` package is not required.

To provide an idea of how the datasets are arranged, we include screenshots
of `datadictionary` and `dwelling`:
